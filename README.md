# dsp_nmigen
DSP Blocks for the nMigen (Python) Toolbox

This repo is currently used for collaborative development of DSP blocks implemented in the nMigen language, it is more like an untidy desktop where something nice might evolve. The medium-term goal is to provide a library of useful DSP functions with test cases and documentation.

## Ideas

- Test documentation using https://github.com/SymbiFlow/sphinxcontrib-hdl-diagrams
- Provide a testbench for simple evaluation of new filter blocks
- Provide examples and an interface for integrating filter modules into https://github.com/chipmuenk/pyfda
